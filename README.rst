Multi-Party Encrypted Messaging Protocol
========================================

This repository contains a design document on the `mpEnc` protocol suite, an
effort towards an end-to-end secure private group messaging protocol. It has
security properties similar to the popular two-party `OTR` protocol, as well as
some additional features and properties useful for groups.

Building
--------

The documentation is written using the Sphinx documentation tool. You may run
`make html` in a shell (Unix) or command prompt (Windows) in this directory to
generate it, or alternatively any of the targets listed in `make help`.
